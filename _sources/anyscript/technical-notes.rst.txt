Technical notes
**************************************

This section is dedicated to elaborate on certain areas of AnyBody's 
simulation functionality. Typically, this covers several AnyScript object types.

We use the format of *technical notes* to explain these topics. 
Typically, a technical note is PDF file or another downloadable file.
Each topic will contain a short introduction followed by links to documents
and potentially other related resources.
