.. .. note:: This manual is partially generated by a software with access
..     to the data structure of AnyBody. The generated information should therefore
..     always an accurate map of the associated version of AnyBody, cf. the version
..     number on the title page.

.. AnyScript™ is continuously being developed and so is the information in this
.. manual. The newest version can always be found on
.. `AnyBody Technology’s homepage <http://www.anybodytech.com>`_.

Please do not hesitate to contact AnyBody Technology if you need more
information or have suggestions for improvements of this manual or the
functionality in AnyScript™.

.. This introductional chapter explains some general issues and terminology
.. associated with the AnyScript™ language and the data structure in AnyBody.
.. AnyScript™ is an object-oriented language with a fixed set of available data
.. types (classes). This means that you cannot define your own types and you
.. cannot, like in a programming language, write algorithms. An AnyScript™ file is
.. purely consisting of definitions (declarations) of objects and the internal data
.. structure in AnyBody maps these definitions completely.
