Environment variables
========================================

The Preprocessor contains a number of standard definitions, equivalent
to ``#define`` and ``#path`` statements pre-defined by the system. They can be
of assistance for handling a more advanced model structure and make
models easier to maintain. Some typical objectives for these definitions
are

-  Controlling model’s compatibility with different version of
   AnyBody software.

-  Path handling for convenient and systematic linkage between model
   parts, for instance application model files, body model files (e.g.
   installed AMMR version or your own modified version), and data output
   paths.

-  Providing information that can be convenient to tag the output your
   model and a specific run.

.. seealso:: The example model :ref:`StandardDefs <demo-Preprocessor.StandardDefs>`
       for a demonstration of the standard definitions available in the current version.

and load argument definitions". Notice that it also contains definitions
made in a macro load command and with AnyBody program arguments.
