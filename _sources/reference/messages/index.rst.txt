Errors, warnings and messages
#################################

The AnyBody™ core has a system for sending messages to the user. This system provides each
messages with an ID, the Message ID, which can be used as reference for finding further information.

The messages are group within these three main categories:

.. Most "messages" contains two messages a short and an extended. The shorter is the one that is send
.. to the user interface and displayed during the execution of AnyBody™ operations, whereas the extended
.. message is intended to provide more information to the user who is not familiar with the particular
.. issue. Both short and extended version of all messages are found in this manual ordered according
.. to their Message ID.

A short version of the message is displayed within AnyBody's output window. The
beginning of the message shows the Message ID. In the AnyBody™ GUI application,
double-clicking the Message ID will bring up this reference manual with an extended
version of the error messages. If there is additional help on how to deal with this
kind of errors the reference manual may provide links to more resources.

Issues associated with special views in GUI application, such as Model View and
Chart Views, will typically be displayed directly inside these view.

The message system also includes logging facilities consisting of multiple log files. The AnyBody™ user interfaces
displays the contents of main output log file. This file is located in a user-specific Application Data directory
(e.g. :file:`C:\\Documents and Settings\\{UserName}\\Application Data\\AnyBody Technology\\AnyBody.{x.x.x}`). The log file is
named :file:`AnyBody.output.log` or :file:`AnyBody.{XX}.output.log`, where ``XX`` is a number allowing for multiple sessions of
AnyBody™ running at the same time with their own log file. Additionally, the system has an extended log file,
called :file:`AnyBody.full.log` or :file:`AnyBody.{XX}.full.log`. This so called full log file contains everything from the
ordinary log plus occasionally additional information. This additional is considered unnecessary to be
displayed in the user interfaces of AnyBody™ and can only be found in the full log.

.. rubric:: severity groups

All messages are categorized into severity groups that defines how the system treats the given situation.


.. list-table:: List tables can have captions like this one.
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Severity Level
      - Operations
      - Description
    * - Notice
      - Continues
      - Simple notification
    * - Warning
      - Continues
      - A warning that is typically not important for your work unless you are having particular problems.
    * - Important warning
      - Continues
      - An important issue that allows you to continue but requires your attention.
    * - Error
      - Continues, but operation will fail
      - An issue that enforces the system to stop the given operation eventually, but it may continue beyond the point of the problem.
    * - Fatal Error
      - Stops
      - An issue that enforces the system to stop the given operation at once.
    * - Fatal System Error
      - Stops [#f1]_
      - A fatal error has occurred which is not properly handled by the system and may therefore lead to unpredictable results.


.. All messages belong to a group, so called message groups, depending on the module that handles the particular type of message.
.. A group is defined as covering a certain topic and the groups are ordered hiaracially allowing general groups to consist of one or
.. more subgroups in multiple levels. Each groups is given a short name (acronym) consisting of typically three letters.
.. Both message and group ids are assembled of these acronyms, i.e., the particular group acronym preceded with its supergroup's id.
.. Message ids have an additional numeric identifier that defined its position in its group.

.. [#f1] Such errors may crash the system eventually and in any case restarting AnyBody™ is recommened.
